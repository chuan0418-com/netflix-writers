Netflix AI Greenlight Challenge: Can Data Science Predict the Next Hit Drama?

## Quickstart

Install required system packages for your operating system:

- [Windows](./setup/windows/setup.ps1)
- [macOS](./setup/macos/setup.sh)
- [Linux](./setup/linux/setup.sh)

Initialize your environment. This includes creating and activating a Python virtual
environment, and then downloading data files for Netflix, IMDb and The Movie
Database (TMDB). The final dataset will be located at `./netflix/db/netflix_enriched_dataset.csv`.

**The setup process will take between 5 and 15 minutes depending on your compute
device and your Internet connection.**
